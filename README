I downloaded them from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/conterminous/2008/software/.

We are going to reprocess this data using OpenGEM, and then try and validate
the output against http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/conterminous/2008/data/.

We have made efforts to process this suite using the instructions provided at
http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/conterminous/2008/software/documentation.php

The underlying historical catalogs that were used to generate the source zones
used in these models are online at http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/conterminous/2008/catalogs/

As always, feedback and discussion is appreciated.
